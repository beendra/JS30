## JS30

During my bootcamp, the module I struggled the most with was learning JavaScript so now I want to master it. Practice makes perfect, so I'm setting out to complete the #JavaScript30 challenge in order to increase my understanding of the language and sharpen my skills.


I will be [blogging](https://dev.to/beendra) about the challenge as I go along so please check that out!
